Inferring the ploidy level of individuals and estimating allele frequency in polysomic inheritance from ambiguous genotypes.

A significant proportion of plant species are polyploids, with ploidy levels sometimes varying intra-specifically among individuals or populations. Current techniques to determine the ploidy status of individuals, e.g. flow cytometry, chromosome counts or by genotyping-by-sequencing, are often cumbersome. 

Based on the genotypic frequencies for polysomic inheritance under double-reduction, we developed a model to estimate allele frequency and infer the ploidy status of individuals from the ambiguous genotype (i.e. electrophoresis bandtype) of codominant genetic markers. This software also accounts for the null alleles, negative amplification, false alleles and self-fertilization.
